This project explores how modern poker AI techniques can be used to solve and play Liar’s Dice, the bluffing dice game popularised by Liar’s Bar.

Liar’s Dice captures the same strategic challenges in a compact, solvable environment:
Players must reason about hidden private information
Optimal play requires mixed strategies and bluffing
The game supports rigorous evaluation in the 2-player setting

This project was inspired by Liberatus. https://thegradient.pub/libratus-poker/
